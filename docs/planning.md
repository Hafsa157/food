# Project Proposal

## Business Case
### Planning section written by: Hafsa Robleh

#### Problem statement
The problem addressed by this project is that people find it challenging to check the hygiene standards of food businesses due to a lack of reliable, up-to-date information on food hygiene ratings for local businesses, This makes it difficult to decide where to eat or shop. While food hygiene ratings are available online, the information is scattered across different websites and isn't easily accessible. This makes it difficult for people to quickly check how clean a food business is before they visit. 


### Business benefits
- Customers will be able to easily access information about how clean food businesses are, helping them choose safer places to eat. 

- It will encourage businesses to maintain higher hygiene standards since their ratings will be publicly accessible.  

- It will provide easier access to and understanding hygiene ratings, without the need to search through different websites.  

- It will increase customer engagement and make people want to use the app regularly.  

 

### Options Considered
- Manually searching Bristol open data council websites; however, this is difficult because the information is scattered and not easily accessible. 

- Third-party apps may show food hygiene ratings but often lack complete information for Bristol and are not regularly updated.  

- The Food Standard Agency (FSA) has a website that provides food hygiene ratings; however, it may not be user-friendly or offer the additional features that this project aims to provide, such as easier search options and a better layout and design.  

 
  
### Expected Risks
- Ensuring that the data is updated regularly to reflect real-time hygiene ratings. 

- Convincing users to switch to this platform from other established services. 

- Handling technical difficulties when connecting various data sources or managing API failures, which could disrupt the availability of 
  hygiene data. 

- Ensuring that the platform is easy to navigate, use, and understand.  

- Since the platform deals with public data, it must have strong security to protect it from unauthorised access or data tampering.



## Project Scope
- A map showing food hygiene ratings for Bristol-based businesses. 

- Users can search to find businesses by name and location. 

- Users can hover and click to view detailed hygiene information about each business. 

- Users can view real-time from the Bristol Open Data API.
